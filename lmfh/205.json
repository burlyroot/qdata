{ "msg": "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach when feeling out of sight For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of every day's Most quiet need; by sun and candlelight. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise." },
